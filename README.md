- 👋 Hi, I’m Evan Peikon. I'm a computational biologist and bioengineer working at the intersections of molecular medicine, multiomics, and network biology. 
- 🧪  In 2020, I co-founded NNOXX, a spin-out from the Harrington Discovery Institute at Case Western, where my work spans developing novel develop digital and molecular biosensors, measurement algorithms, and multi-modal analysis frameworks. 
- 🧬 I'm also a PhD student in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at GMU, where my research focuses on identifying predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic protein biomarkers and network signatures in cancer and infectious disease.
- 💀 In my free time I write for [Sequence & Destroy](https://sequenceanddestroy.substack.com), contribute to NASA GeneLab's Brain Analysis Working Group, and advise several bio/health tech startups. 
- 📬 You can reach me at evanpeikon@gmail.com
