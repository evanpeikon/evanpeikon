- 👋 Hi, I’m @evanpeikon
- 🧪 I'm a bioinformatics scientist and computational biologist specializing in wearable biosensor development, multiomics data analysis, time series biometric analysis, and network modeling.
- 🏋️‍♂️ I began my career as a physiologist and data scientist working with professional athletes, teams, and military special operations before co-founding NNOXX, where I lead the biosensor and bio-algorithm development teams.
- 🚀 In my free time, I'm an active contributor to NASA GeneLab's Alzheimer's Disease & Brain Resilience analysis working group where I apply bioinformatics approaches to understand neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and countermeasures. 
- 🧬 I'm also pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology part-time at George Mason Universities School of Systems Biology.
- 💻 I write about bioinformatics, biotechnology, and wearable technology at [Decoding Biology](https://decodingbiology.substack.com ). I also document my research, ideas under development , and experimental outcomes at [Sequence & Destroy](https://sequenceanddestroy.substack.com). 
- 📬 You can reach me at evanpeikon@gmail.com
