- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @evanpeikon
- ðŸ§ª I'm a computational biologist and bioengineer working at the intersections of wearable technology, digital and molecular biomarkers, and network biology, with applications in precision medicine and biodefense.
- ðŸ©» I started my career in the human performance space, working with Olympians, professional sports teams, and DoD Human Systems Integration programs. My work spanned developing physiological assessment protocols, predictive algorithms, and analysis platforms that integrated physical, environmental, and biosensing modalities to solve organizations' most pressing issues.
- ðŸ§¬ In 2020, I co-founded NNOXX, a spin-out from the Harrington Discovery Institute at Case Western, where I work on developing new bio-optical sensing technologies and biomarker measurement algorithms.
- ðŸ§« I'm also working on a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at GMU, where I where I research multiomics-based approaches to identifying predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic network signatures in cancer and infectious diseases.  
- ðŸ’€ In my free time I write for [Sequence & Destroy](https://sequenceanddestroy.substack.com). Iâ€™m also a contributor to NASA GeneLab's Brain Analysis Working Group, where I study neurodegenerative disease countermeasures.
