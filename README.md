- 👋 Hi, I’m @evanpeikon
- 🧪 I'm a bioinformatician and physiologist with a background in wearable biosensor development, multi-omics data analysis, and biomarker discovery.
- 🏋️‍♂️ I began my career as a physiologist and data scientist working with professional athletes and teams before co-founding NNOXX, where I lead the biosensor and bio-algorithm development teams.
- 🚀 In my free time, I'm an active contributor to NASA GeneLab's Alzheimer's Disease & Brain Resilience analysis working group. 
- 🧬 I'm also pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at George Mason Universities School of Systems Biology. Currently, I'm working on identifying differences in signaling architecture between tumor samples with high and low expression of ADC targets. 
- 💻 I blog about bioinformatics, wearable technology, and biotechnology at [Decoding Biology](https://decodingbiology.substack.com ).
- 📬 You can reach me at evanpeikon@gmail.com
