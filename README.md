- 👋 Hi, I’m Evan Peikon. I'm a computational biologist and bioengineer working at the intersections of molecular medicine, multiomics, and network biology. I'm interested in developing computational models to understand cancer evolution and mechanisms of treatment resistance with the goal of better personalizing treatment for cancer patients. 
- 🧪 In 2020, I co-founded NNOXX, a spin-out from the Harrington Discovery Institute at Case Western, where I currently work on developing novel digital and molecular biosensors and multi-modal data analysis frameworks. My work here draws from several fields including bio-optics, integrative physiology, biochemistry, and biophysics. 
- 🧬 I'm also a PhD student at George Mason University, where my primary research focus is identifying predictive and prognostic protein biomarkers and network signatures in HER2- breast cancer. My work also includes developing a biological knowledge graph and downstream analysis frameworks that integrate bio-ontologies and curated data from public databases with cohort and patient-specific multi-omics data to predict phenotypic changes following physiological perturbation.
- 💀 You can find my writing at [Sequence & Destroy](https://sequenceanddestroy.substack.com), where I share what I'm currently learning, working on, and thinking about.
