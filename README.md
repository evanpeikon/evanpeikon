- 👋 Hi, I’m @evanpeikon
- 🧪 I'm a computational biologist and bioengineer working at the intersections of wearable biosensors, digital and molecular biomarkers, and network biology.  
- 🩻 I started my career as an integrative physiologist and biomedical data scientist in the human performance space, working with Olympians, professional sports teams, and the DoD. My work here spanned developing assessment protocols, algorithms, and analysis software utilizing new biosensing modalities and digital biomarkers.
- 🧬 In 2020, I co-founded NNOXX, a spin-out from the Harrington Discovery Institute at Case Western, where I now lead the biomarker discovery and algorithm development teams. 
- 🧫 I'm also working on a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at GMU, where I research network-based approaches to predicting clinical symptomology from biomarker data, with applications in biodefense, and multiomics approaches to studying tumor heterogeneity in personalized cancer treatment. 
- 🚀 In my free time I write for [Sequence & Destroy](https://sequenceanddestroy.substack.com). I’m also an active contributor to NASA GeneLab's Alzheimers Disease/Brain Resilience analysis working group, where I study neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and countermeasures.
