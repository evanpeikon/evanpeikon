- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @evanpeikon
- ðŸ§ª I'm a bioinformatics scientist and computational biologist working at the intersections of wearable biosensors, digital biomarkers, multiomics, and network modeling.  
- ðŸ©» I began my career as an integrative physiologist and biomedical data scientist in the human performance space, working with Olympians, professional sports teams, and the DoD. My work here spanned developing assessment protocols, analysis tools, and decision making frameworks utilizing new biosensing modalities and digital biomarkers.
- ðŸ§¬ In 2020, I co-founded NNOXX, a spin-out from the Harrington Discovery Institute at Case Western, where I now lead the biomarker discovery and algorithm development teams.
- ðŸ§« I'm also working on a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at GMU, where I research network-based approaches to predicting clinical symptomology from biomarker data, with applications in biodefense, and multiomics approaches to studying tumor heterogeneity in personalized cancer treatment. 
- ðŸš€ In my free time I write technical articles at [Decoding Biology](https://decodingbiology.substack.com ). Iâ€™m also an active contributor to NASA GeneLab's Alzheimers Disease/Brain Resilience analysis working group, where I study neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and countermeasures.
