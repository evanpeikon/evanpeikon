- 👋 Hi, I’m @evanpeikon
- 🧪 I'm a bioinformatician, physiologist, and entrepreneur with a background in wearable biosensor development and multi-omics data analysis. 
- 🏋️‍♂️ I began my career as a physiologist and data scientist working with professional athletes and teams before co-founding NNOXX, where I lead the biosensor and bio-algorithm development teams.
- 🧬 I'm also currently pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology with the aim of developing new technologies to identify disease biomarkers and address questions in medical science that could not be answered previously.
- 💻 I blog about bioinformatics, wearable technology, and biotechnology at [Decoding Biology](https://decodingbiology.substack.com ).
- 📬 You can reach me at evanpeikon@gmail.com
