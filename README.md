- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @evanpeikon
- ðŸ§ª I'm a computational biologist and bioengineer working at the intersections of wearable biosensors, digital and molecular biomarkers, and precision medicine. 
- ðŸ©» I started my career as an integrative physiologist and biomedical data scientist in the human performance space, working with Olympians, professional sports teams, and the DoD. My work here spanned developing assessment protocols, algorithms, and analysis software utilizing new biosensing modalities and digital biomarkers.
- ðŸ§¬ In 2020, I co-founded NNOXX, a spin-out from the Harrington Discovery Institute at Case Western, where I now lead the biomarker discovery and algorithm development teams. 
- ðŸ§« I'm also working on a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at GMU, where I where I research multiomics-based approaches to identifying predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic network signatures in cancer and infectious diseases.  
- ðŸ’€ In my free time I write for [Sequence & Destroy](https://sequenceanddestroy.substack.com). Iâ€™m also a contributor to NASA GeneLab's Brain Analysis Working Group, where I study neurodegenerative disease countermeasures.
