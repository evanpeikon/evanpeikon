- 👋 Hi, I’m @evanpeikon
- 🧪 I'm a bioinformatics scientist and computational biologist working at the intersections of wearable biosensor technology, multiomic data analysis, time-series biometric analysis, and network modeling. 
- 🏋️‍♂️ I began my career as a physiologist and biomedical data scientist working with olympians, professional athletes and teams, and human performance groups within the DoD before co-founding NNOXX, where I lead the biomarker discovery and algorithm development teams.
- 🚀 I'm also an active contributor to NASA GeneLab's Alzheimers Disease/Brain Resilience analysis working group, where I study neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and countermeasures. 
- 🧬 Additionally, I'm working on a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at GMU's School of System's Biology, where I work on network-based aproaches to predicting clinical symptomology from multiomic data and research applied proteomics in cancer. 
- 💻 I write in-depth technical articles at [Decoding Biology](https://decodingbiology.substack.com ).
- 📬 You can reach me at evanpeikon@gmail.com
