- 👋 Hi, I’m @evanpeikon
- 🧪 I'm a computational biologist, physiologist, and entrepreneur with a background in wearable biosensor development, multi-omics data analysis, and biomarker discovery.
- 🏋️‍♂️ I spent ~7 years as a physiologist and data scientist for professional athletes and teams before co-founding NNOXX, where I lead the biosensor and bio-algorithm development teams. 
- 🧬 I'm also currently pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at George Mason University's School of Systems Biology.
- 💻 I blog about bioinformatics, wearable technology, and biotechnology at [Decoding Biology](https://decodingbiology.substack.com ).
- 📬 You can reach me at evanpeikon@gmail.com
