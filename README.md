i- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @evanpeikon
- ðŸ§ª I'm a bioinformatics scientist and computational biologist working at the intersections of wearable biosensors, multiomics, and network modeling. 
- ðŸ©» I began my career as an integrative physiologist and biomedical data scientist in the human performance space, working with Olympians, professional sports teams, and the DoD. My work here spanned developing assessment protocols, analysis tools, and decision making frameworks utilizing new biosensing modalities and digital biomarkers.
- ðŸ§¬ In 2020, I co-founded NNOXX, a spin-out from the Harrington Discovery Institute at Case Western, where I now lead the biomarker discovery and algorithm development teams.
- ðŸ§« I'm also working on a PhD in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at GMU, where my research centers on network-based approaches to predicting clinical symptomology from multiomic data (with applications in pandemic response) and applied proteomics in cancer (personalized therapy). 
- ðŸš€ In my free time I write in-depth technical articles at [Decoding Biology](https://decodingbiology.substack.com ). Iâ€™m also an active contributor to NASA GeneLab's Alzheimers Disease/Brain Resilience analysis working group, where I study neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and countermeasures.
